## UI Hall of Fame and Shame

- usability is about creating effective user interfaces (UIs)
- help message is indicative of a flawed approach to usability

## Define

- how well users can use the system's functionality
  - learnability: is it easy to learn
  - efficiency: once learned, is ti fast to use
  - safety: are errors few and recoverable

## Learnability

- recognition
- recall
- four styles: command language(CL), menus and forms(MF), direct manipulation(DM) and speech dialog(SD)

### Model

- system model: how the system actually works.
- interface model: the model that the system presents to the user through its user interface.
- user model: how the user thinks the system work.

## Efficiency

Maintenance rehearsal is useless for moving information into long-term memory. It need elaborative rehearsal.

- Point: Fitts's Law: Time `T` to move your hand to a target of size `S` at distance `D` away is: `T = Reaction Time + Movement Time = a + b log(D/S + 1)`
- Stering: `T = a + b D/S`

### Improve

- Make frequently-used targets big
  - Use snapping in drawing editors
- Put targets used together near each other
- Use screen corners and screen edges
- Avoid steering tasks

### Shortcuts

- keyboard shortcuts
- defaults & pending delete
- history
- autocomplete
- aggregation
- anticipation
